[-] #Sets the value of the cell to 0. If you write more code behind it (e.g. +++++), you can assign any value to the cell you want.
[>+<-] #Transfers the value of the cell to the one to the right. By changing the number of characters > and < you can specify the cell to which the value is transferred. At the end the data pointer is back in the cell in
        which the value was first located.
